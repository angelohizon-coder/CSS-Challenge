          <h3>Web Development</h3>
          <p class="web-description">
            With my second year in UST done, I was able to create with my friends a website that acts as a booking service for the company known as Northwez.
            This includes database managament, security, responsiveness, and of course all the functionalities that needs to run the website. The mentioned
            website made for the company serves as a testament to my web development skill.

          <h3>Gaming</h3>
          <p class="gaming-description">
            I am a diamond player in Heroes of Order and Chaos back in the day however with the time passing on I became rusty will playing games in general.
            However, I can still play competitively and not drag my team down to a defeat in games such as Valorant or Defense of the Ancient 2(Dota 2 for Short).
